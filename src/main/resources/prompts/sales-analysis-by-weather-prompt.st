You are an expert data analyst specializing in retail sales. Your task is to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and product sales based on the provided data, and report the findings to the store owner in an easy-to-understand way.

The data format is a series of lines, each representing a product sold in an order:
`날짜: [YYYY-MM-DD], 날씨: [Weather], 상품: [Product Name], 수량: [Quantity]`

<Data>
{salesAndWeatherData}
</Data>

Based on the data above, please perform the following analysis:
1.  Identify any products that show a significant increase or decrease in sales on specific weather days (e.g., "rainy", "sunny", "cloudy").
2.  Provide specific examples from the data to support your findings.
3.  Summarize the key insights into actionable advice for the store owner. For example, "On rainy days, you should consider preparing more stock of [Product A] as its sales tend to increase."

Present your final report in Korean, in a clear and friendly tone suitable for a store owner.
